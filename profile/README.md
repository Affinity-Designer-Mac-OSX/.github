## What is Affinity Designer?  
Affinity Designer is a next-generation vector and graphic design software developed by **Serif** for creative professionals. It’s a powerful alternative to Adobe Illustrator, combining vector and raster tools in one seamless environment — allowing you to switch between precision vector work and expressive pixel-based art instantly.  

The app is fully optimized for **macOS and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)**, delivering real-time performance even with complex projects. With full Metal acceleration, live effects, and non-destructive editing, designers can work faster and smarter.  

Affinity Designer supports CMYK, RGB, LAB color spaces, and professional typography tools, making it suitable for everything from UI design and branding to print and concept art.  
Multiple artboards, grids, snapping, and an advanced pen tool help streamline your creative workflow. The interface is minimal yet packed with depth — giving you the freedom to focus purely on design.  

Unlike subscription-based software, Affinity Designer offers a **one-time license**, making it a cost-effective and professional choice for long-term creative work.
